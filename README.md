# portfolio-prototype
## The Plan
- Maybe just make a forum for a game that I'm making and scrap the other idea for now for a future learning goal.
- Recreate my portfolio website with additional features and a better front-end.
## Proposal
> For a long time, it feels as though I have never spent enough time on my portfolio website. Throughout this past year, I have been redesigning my portfolio multiple times, attempting to find the right design.
>
> This time I believe I have the right idea and additionally, this allows me to challenge my ability to create front-end designs and utilize front-end frameworks in a meaningful way.
>

### Problem Statement
> My current design for my website (https://terrellterry.online) doesn't have much eye catching detail as I wished it would. It also doesn't have a functional blog page.
